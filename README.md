Prompt 1: I need you to be an expert at SEO. Please analyze this website and offer SEO recommendations: https://www.mubashirhassan.com

Prompt 2: Please go into my Google Drive and access the following: Best Investment for Doubling $250,000_TSLA, NVIDIA, or META_zip . It contains a bunch of investment analysis for how I can turn 250,000 into 500K and recommends which stock of the three (TSLA, NVIDIA, or META) I should purchase. Please give feedback on their findings and make the use case for or against what it found. I need you to be honest and rational.

Prompt 3: I would like you to give me an in-depth course on how to practically use Manus AI for automating your work. Focus on real-world use cases and tools that are being deployed in the real world by early adopters, and focused on real problems that anyone might face. The course should be to the point, but in depth enough on the more complex parts for beginners to understand. Include examples, images, and quizzes to ensure my comprehension. Start with the outline that we can then feed into the next Manus chat so we don’t go over context windows.

Prompt 4: I have 250.00 and I want to know where I should invest it to turn it into 500.00 as efficiently as possible. I am looking at putting it in TSLA stock, NVIDIA stock, or META stock—let me know which of these you think is the best and why.
