## Prompt 6:

Manus, I need a new website. I’ve got a very old one that I built when I was learning Hugo, the static site generator back in 2021 or so. I would like you to review what I have, but then probably just start from scratch. I’ll give you my GitHub repo where the Hugo project lives. And I do deploy via Netlify straight from the GitHub main branch. I’d like that to still be the case. I need a brand-new website that’s accurately reflecting what I currently do. I’ll give you my main three things: 2 newsletters and a YouTube channel. I have all the other normal social links that you can surely find yourself. Build a great, high-converting single-page home page for my website. Use the simplest possible tech. I don’t want to fool with npm etc. Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript if possible. I don’t think we need a static site generator anymore. You may use a CSS library like Tailwind. Just make it clean and minimal, but the design should be eye-catching. Don’t sleep on this. I don’t want it to look like every other Apple-esque site out there. Be clean, be cool, be consistent.
Current live site: http://www.mubashirhassan.com/
Current GitHub (if you need for reference but don’t use all the old posts, projects, etc.): https://github.com/sites/cctroll-theme

## Prompt 7:
Hello Manus, I want to create my own dropshipping business. I'm planning to use Shopify as my selling platform, and I need you to create a to-do list of everything required to get started. I have minimal experience, and I'm not sure what the best approach is. Please guide me through the process.

Go to www.ZikAnalytics.com using the credentials I provided earlier. Using their latest product research tools, identify the top products I can sell in my dropshipping store. I want products with at least a 75% profit margin and high demand on social media. Also, use Zik Analytics to match the products you found with reliable suppliers from AliExpress.

I've picked 5 products from the ones you found using Zik Analytics. I'm attaching the Google Docs file with my selected products. Now, I need you to:

Use the email address I provided earlier to set up a Shopify store for me.
Optimize the product pages to maximize conversions.
Adjust all necessary Shopify settings to ensure the store is ready for sales—including applying for the best payment gateway.
Design the dropshipping store in a user-friendly way to drive the highest conversion rate possible.
And create a web search to check if more things are needed to have a fully maximized dropshipping store ready to generate sales.

I'm sharing with you raw videos and images of the products I want to market across all the social media platforms that you have access to.

Edit the videos from the raw materials I provide, post daily on each platform, and fit the video or image to the social media platform. Engage with people who comment and like the posts, and reshare the posts to increase community engagement.

This is an ongoing task, not a one-time request. Also, notify me whenever you need more raw content from me.
I previously shared access with you to my Facebook Ads account. Using the raw materials I provided, create engaging video and image ads.
Set up targeting based on all the knowledge you have about my dropshipping store, including insights from active campaigns and online searches.
My paid ads daily budget is $30, and you can increase it by up to 50% if the daily ROAS is above 3.5.
Make sure to optimize each ad continuously to maintain at least a 3.5 ROAS, and everyday at 4 PM I want you to provide me with a detailed activity report. This is a daily task.

For every order in my store, fulfill it to the customer's address.
I'm sourcing all products from AliExpress, and you can find the product source links in this Google Drive file.
Place the orders 5 hours after purchase.
Notify me for approval if an order costs more than $100.
Every day at 4 PM, send me a detailed report of all fulfilled orders.

Integrate with my Klaviyo account, which I have already shared access to.
Create a complete email sequence for abandoned cart recovery—including a discount code to encourage conversions.
Set up an automated funnel for buyers who have already purchased from my store. This should include:
Order confirmation emails with tracking updates
A post-purchase follow-up to increase engagement
A special offer: a 25% discount for buyers who share and tag an Instagram story or post featuring the product
I also need you to verify that each customer has actually posted the story or post before sending them the coupon code.
Additionally, write the email content for each step of the sequence, ensuring that the buyer’s name appears in every email.

Ensure a consistent layout and navigation bar across all HTML files for smooth movement between modules. The overall tone should be friendly, fun, and non-technical, making the course enjoyable and accessible even for a young learner with no prior knowledge of AI or coding.

I want to create a calorie tracking mobile app for iOS. Users are first onboarded by creating their health habits and goals for calorie tracking. Before they can proceed, they need to sign up with a paywall. To track their calories, users shall easily capture their meals by taking pictures of them. Then we will use Deepseek VI2 OCR VLM (Vision Language Model) to interpret the image and determine what food items, the amounts, etc. And from this, a Deepseek LLM model will determine the items and calories breakdown. Multiple items can be added for each meal, single items, and pictures of an entire composite meal. Then we will save these data for the user. It shall track all meals for the day, the calories and macronutrients per meal, keep track of remaining calories, etc. It shall in essence be a standard calorie tracking app, BUT with the much easier implementation for users by simply taking pictures of what they are eating, and let the AI behind the scenes do the rest. The UI for user onboarding and the main screens will be provided, so use those as a start for how it should look like.
